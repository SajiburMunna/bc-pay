# BC Pay - Benevolent Contribution System

## 📌 Project Overview
BC Pay is a modern web-based system designed to digitize and streamline the company's fine collection process for rule violations. Employees contribute a fixed amount to the BC Pay fund when they break company rules, turning infractions into a fun, team-building initiative. The system allows the CEO, HR, and Team Leads to efficiently manage violations, track contributions, and generate reports.
